[Work in Progress] 

My first basic project using the C# Entity Framework and LINQ. See Wiki tab for current progress blog posts.
For now, stores Dishes and their Ingredients objects in a MySQL database then finds all Dishes containing the "gluten" allergen. These are printed to the console. 
The Dishes and Ingredients objects are generated by reading in a sample JSON file defining info such as what ingredients are in a dish and what allergens are in an ingredient. (Currently replacing hard-code in main method with the output from the JSON file).

After that I plan to make a front-end allowing users to filter existing recipes and submit their own new dishes and ingredients through RESTful HTTP requests.

Divided into 4 tables: Dishes, DishIngredientList, DishIngredients, Ingredients
Dishes have a foreign key referencing their DishIngredientList_ID and DishIngredientLists have a foreign key referencing their Dish_ID.
DishIngredients have a foreign key referencing an Ingredient and a foreign key referencing a DishIngredientList.
Ingredients store only their ID, name, and allergen info.
